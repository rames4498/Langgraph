##  Practice Task 

### Task 4: Handle multiple greeting variations

 Modify the graph so that it can also detect "hello" and "hey" as valid greetings (and treat them the same as "hi").

 Solution hint:
Update choose_greeting_node so that if "hi", "hello", or "hey" appear in the input, it routes to the "hi_greeting" node.

---

### Task 5: Add a "shout mode" 

 Add a new field "shout" (boolean) in the state.

* If shout=True, the final greeting should be returned in ALL CAPS.
* If shout=False, keep normal behavior.

 Solution hint:
Add a "shout_node" at the end that checks state["shout"] and modifies the greeting string accordingly before sending to END.

---

### Task 6: Track how many greetings were processed 

 Add a "counter" field to the state that increments by 1 each time the graph is run.

* First run → counter=1
* Second run → counter=2
* …and so on.

 Solution hint:
You’ll need a "counter_node" that reads the existing counter (if any) and adds 1. Place it just before the END.
